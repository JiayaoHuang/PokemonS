# PokemonS

This is an Android application which can provide the location of Pokemon in Pokemon GO!.

It is calling this "http://www.pokesnipers.com/api/v1/pokemon.json" public API (may not be working anymore), to retrieve the Pokemon locations and show them in the Google Map. It also save the data into the local database using SQLite.
